The cliff face is 9 km in length and 1400 meters vertically, with an average slope of 9.9 degrees.   The ridge top is at 800m.  The ridge is a seaward-vergent thrust, with most of the west-facing forelimb missing due to failure and erosion (Godfinger et al., Trehu et al., Johnson et al.).This site was the subject of numerous ALVIN dives in which the character of the open slope is observed, and video of this exists.  Teh video and GEOMAR camera tows show (Bohrmann et al) the ridge top is coverd in a carapace of overlapping and deformed carbonates, and the open fase is loose uncolidated sand.  The HRBW cores form an E-W transect, from proximal to the cliff, medim distance, and more distal in teh basin.  Proximal cores have a high resolution expandes sectiosn ! 1500 years in length.  Medial cores have a full Holocene section, and the distal core has a compaced thin section extendin well into teh Pleistocene.  All cores at this site have what appears to be a steady rain of silty sandy materisl, presumably from the nearby cliff, making turbidite tail boundary calls more difficult.  This site also as a higher than typical number of thin wispy  lamellae, perhaps also due to priximal source, or to other causes.   The site isolation likely reduces the turbidity current sources to: Self failure, gas hydrate destabilization events, and crustal, slab or plate boundary earthquakes.  This site is a fully isolated basin, ringed on all sides by high ridges.  Lowest pass elevation into this basin is too high for intrusion of turbidity currents external to the site (400m, north side).  There are no other obvious canyon or channel pathward leading in the direction of this site.  "

The cliff face is 9 km in length and 1400 meters vertically, with an average slope of 9.9 degrees.   The ridge top is at 800m.  The ridge is a seaward-vergent thrust, with most of the west-facing forelimb missing due to failure and erosion (Godfinger et al., Trehu et al., Johnson et al.).This site was the subject of numerous ALVIN dives in which the character of the open slope is observed, and video of this exists.  Teh video and GEOMAR camera tows show (Bohrmann et al) the ridge top is coverd in a carapace of overlapping and deformed carbonates, and the open fase is loose uncolidated sand.  The HRBW cores form an E-W transect, from proximal to the cliff, medim distance, and more distal in teh basin.  Proximal cores have a high resolution expandes sectiosn ! 1500 years in length.  Medial cores have a full Holocene section, and the distal core has a compaced thin section extendin well into teh Pleistocene.  All cores at this site have what appears to be a steady rain of silty sandy materisl, presumably from the nearby cliff, making turbidite tail boundary calls more difficult.  This site also as a higher than typical number of thin wispy  lamellae, perhaps also due to priximal source, or to other causes.   The site isolation likely reduces the turbidity current sources to: Self failure, gas hydrate destabilization events, and crustal, slab or plate boundary earthquakes.  This site is a fully isolated basin, ringed on all sides by high ridges.  Lowest pass elevation into this basin is too high for intrusion of turbidity currents external to the site (400m, north side).  There are no other obvious canyon or channel pathward leading in the direction of this site.  "

The cliff face is 9 km in length and 1400 meters vertically, with an average slope of 9.9 degrees.   The ridge top is at 800m.  The ridge is a seaward-vergent thrust, with most of the west-facing forelimb missing due to failure and erosion (Godfinger et al., Trehu et al., Johnson et al.).This site was the subject of numerous ALVIN dives in which the character of the open slope is observed, and video of this exists.  Teh video and GEOMAR camera tows show (Bohrmann et al) the ridge top is coverd in a carapace of overlapping and deformed carbonates, and the open fase is loose uncolidated sand.  The HRBW cores form an E-W transect, from proximal to the cliff, medim distance, and more distal in teh basin.  Proximal cores have a high resolution expandes sectiosn ! 1500 years in length.  Medial cores have a full Holocene section, and the distal core has a compaced thin section extendin well into teh Pleistocene.  All cores at this site have what appears to be a steady rain of silty sandy materisl, presumably from the nearby cliff, making turbidite tail boundary calls more difficult.  This site also as a higher than typical number of thin wispy  lamellae, perhaps also due to priximal source, or to other causes.   The site isolation likely reduces the turbidity current sources to: Self failure, gas hydrate destabilization events, and crustal, slab or plate boundary earthquakes.  This site is a fully isolated basin, ringed on all sides by high ridges.  Lowest pass elevation into this basin is too high for intrusion of turbidity currents external to the site (400m, north side).

The cliff face is 9 km in length and 1400 meters vertically, with an average slope of 9.9 degrees.   The ridge top is at 800m.  The ridge is a seaward-vergent thrust, with most of the west-facing forelimb missing due to failure and erosion (Godfinger et al., Trehu et al., Johnson et al.).This site was the subject of numerous ALVIN dives in which the character of the open slope is observed, and video of this exists.  Teh video and GEOMAR camera tows show (Bohrmann et al) the ridge top is coverd in a carapace of overlapping and deformed carbonates, and the open fase is loose uncolidated sand.  The HRBW cores form an E-W transect, from proximal to the cliff, medim distance, and more distal in teh basin.  Proximal cores have a high resolution expandes sectiosn ! 1500 years in length.  Medial cores have a full Holocene section, and the distal core has a compaced thin section extendin well into teh Pleistocene.  All cores at this site have what appears to be a steady rain of silty sandy materisl, presumably from the nearby cliff, making turbidite tail boundary calls more difficult.  This site also as a higher than typical number of thin wispy  lamellae, perhaps also due to priximal source, or to other causes.   The site isolation likely reduces the turbidity current sources to: Self failure, gas hydrate destabilization events, and crustal, slab or plate boundary earthquakes.  This site is a fully isolated basin, ringed on all sides by high ridges.  Lowest pass elevation into this basin is too high for intrusion of turbidity currents external to the site (400m, north side).  There are no other obvious canyon or channel pathward leading in the direction of this site.  "

The ridge is a seaward-vergent thrust, with most of the west-facing forelimb missing due to failure and erosion (Godfinger et al., Trehu et al., Johnson et al.).This site was the subject of numerous ALVIN dives in which the character of the open slope is observed, and video of this exists.

The HRBW cores form an E-W transect, from proximal to the cliff, medim distance, and more distal in teh basin.  Proximal cores have a high resolution expandes sectiosn ! 1500 years in length.  Medial cores have a full Holocene section, and the distal core has a compaced thin section extendin well into teh Pleistocene.  All cores at this site have what appears to be a steady rain of silty sandy materisl, presumably from the nearby cliff, making turbidite tail boundary calls more difficult.  This site also as a higher than typical number of thin wispy  lamellae, perhaps also due to priximal source, or to other causes.   The site isolation likely reduces the turbidity current sources to: Self failure, gas hydrate destabilization events, and crustal, slab or plate boundary earthquakes.  This site is a fully isolated basin, ringed on all sides by high ridges.  Lowest pass elevation into this basin is too high for intrusion of turbidity currents external to the site (400m, north side).  There are no other obvious canyon or channel pathward leading in the direction of this site.  "

All cores at this site have what appears to be a steady rain of silty sandy materisl, presumably from the nearby cliff, making turbidite tail boundary calls more difficult.  This site also as a higher than typical number of thin wispy  lamellae, perhaps also due to priximal source, or to other causes.   The site isolation likely reduces the turbidity current sources to: Self failure, gas hydrate destabilization events, and crustal, slab or plate boundary earthquakes.  This site is a fully isolated basin, ringed on all sides by high ridges.  Lowest pass elevation into this basin is too high for intrusion of turbidity currents external to the site (400m, north side).  There are no other obvious canyon or channel pathward leading in the direction of this site.  "

The cliff face is 9 km in length and 1400 meters vertically, with an average slope of 9.9 degrees.   The ridge top is at 800m.  The ridge is a seaward-vergent thrust, with most of the west-facing forelimb missing due to failure and erosion (Godfinger et al., Trehu et al., Johnson et al.).This site was the subject of numerous ALVIN dives in which the character of the open slope is observed, and video of this exists.  Teh video and GEOMAR camera tows show (Bohrmann et al) the ridge top is coverd in a carapace of overlapping and deformed carbonates, and the open fase is loose uncolidated sand.  The HRBW cores form an E-W transect, from proximal to the cliff, medim distance, and more distal in teh basin.  Proximal cores have a high resolution expandes sectiosn ! 1500 years in length.  Medial cores have a full Holocene section, and the distal core has a compaced thin section extendin well into teh Pleistocene.

The upper canyon heads (4) range from 15 -26 km from the coast, providing good isolation from the Rogue River.  It should be noted that although Goldfinger et al.

The canyon is likely relict with respect to Holocene recharge, but may act as a partial conduit for shaking events nontheless.  The Klamath Apron is a very thin apron like Rogue Apron, but barely discernable a the resolution existing multibeam and sidescan data.  The Smith cores are high resolution and expanded records, covering ~ 9800 years in 8 m of core.  However, the grain size and event bed overall densities are relatively low, making the medum to thinner event beds more difficut to interpret.  This is more so in the late Holocene, as sediment supply appears to weaken as it does at many deep water sites with no modern recharge upslope.  The result is thin beds are more bioturbated.  Klamath also is the northern limit of a facies change with respect to turbidite frequency.  The lower half of the cores contain a much higher event frequency than the upper half, a marked and abrupt change.  This change is observed in all cores south of Klamath, and discussed to some extent in Goldfinger et al. (2012, 2013, 2021). The origins of this shift are not fully understood however.  "

The Klamath Apron is a very thin apron like Rogue Apron, but barely discernable a the resolution existing multibeam and sidescan data.  The Smith cores are high resolution and expanded records, covering ~ 9800 years in 8 m of core.  However, the grain size and event bed overall densities are relatively low, making the medum to thinner event beds more difficut to interpret.  This is more so in the late Holocene, as sediment supply appears to weaken as it does at many deep water sites with no modern recharge upslope.  The result is thin beds are more bioturbated.  Klamath also is the northern limit of a facies change with respect to turbidite frequency.  The lower half of the cores contain a much higher event frequency than the upper half, a marked and abrupt change.  This change is observed in all cores south of Klamath, and discussed to some extent in Goldfinger et al. (2012, 2013, 2021). The origins of this shift are not fully understood however.  "

The Smith cores are high resolution and expanded records, covering ~ 9800 years in 8 m of core.  However, the grain size and event bed overall densities are relatively low, making the medum to thinner event beds more difficut to interpret.  This is more so in the late Holocene, as sediment supply appears to weaken as it does at many deep water sites with no modern recharge upslope.  The result is thin beds are more bioturbated.  Klamath also is the northern limit of a facies change with respect to turbidite frequency.  The lower half of the cores contain a much higher event frequency than the upper half, a marked and abrupt change.  This change is observed in all cores south of Klamath, and discussed to some extent in Goldfinger et al. (2012, 2013, 2021). The origins of this shift are not fully understood however.  "
