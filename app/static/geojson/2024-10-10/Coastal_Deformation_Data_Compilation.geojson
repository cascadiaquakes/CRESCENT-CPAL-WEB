(1993), Darienzo & Peterson (1995): Technically there are three ages for the 1MT event, however one does not overlap with the assumed 1700 quake - the other calibrates to 926-686 cal years BP calibrated using OxCal 20. Darienzo and Peterson (1995) report three ages from Gallaway et al. (1992) for \"burial events\" 1, 3 and 6. Peterson et al. (1993), in a field trip guide, also summarize results of Gallaway et al. (1992). Notably, core CB115 studied by Gallaway contained 8 buried peats, not all associated with sand deposits. Three cores at site CB115 record 8 buried peats.\n\nPeterson et al. (2008) and (2013): Radiocarbon data come from analyses of 8 samples of \"bulk organics within or immediately below\" sand layers identified in cores collected by Gallaway et al. (1992). Two other samples collected in 2006 (?) and dated by AMS method. \"Subsidence evidence... is weakly-developed or non-existent in most core sites.\" \n\nWitter (2008) and Witter et al. (2012): Mud-over-sand-over peat stratigraphy observed for sand sheets 1 and 3 suggest subsidence, but this study states that \"data are insufficient to provide conclusive evidence\" for subsidence. This study investigated the same deposits and sites that Peterson et al. (2008) studied."

This contrasts with Briggs' (1994) core descriptions and analysis of cores >10 km from the sea, as compiled in detail by Leonard et al. (2010). For a discussion of Briggs' (1994) interpretations of similar cores in the Siuslaw River estuary, see the supplemental material for Nelson et al. (2020b). Most coastal paleoseismologist have avoided searching for evidence of coseismic subsidence in the Umpqua estuary because, as the largest river basin in the Oregon Coast Range, the estuary is strongly dominated by freshwater and large winter floods. Near and upriver from Highway 101, many marshes are probably underlain by largely freshwater peaty and muddy sediment.  Downriver from the highway much marsh sediment is sandy because of the extensive active and stabalized dune fields to the west along the coast. Thick sand beds, inferred to have been deposited by the 1700 CE tsunami, have been reported along the banks of Steamboat Island, but are hard to distinguish from fluvial sediment.\n"

This contrasts with Briggs' (1994) core descriptions and analysis of cores >10 km from the sea, as compiled in detail by Leonard et al. (2010). For a discussion of Briggs' (1994) interpretations of similar cores in the Siuslaw River estuary, see the supplemental material for Nelson et al. (2020b). Most coastal paleoseismologist have avoided searching for evidence of coseismic subsidence in the Umpqua estuary because, as the largest river basin in the Oregon Coast Range, the estuary is strongly dominated by freshwater and large winter floods. Near and upriver from Highway 101, many marshes are probably underlain by largely freshwater peaty and muddy sediment.  Downriver from the highway much marsh sediment is sandy because of the extensive active and stabalized dune fields to the west along the coast. Thick sand beds, inferred to have been deposited by the 1700 CE tsunami, have been reported along the banks of Steamboat Island, but are hard to distinguish from fluvial sediment.\n"

For a discussion of Briggs' (1994) interpretations of similar cores in the Siuslaw River estuary, see the supplemental material for Nelson et al. (2020b). Most coastal paleoseismologist have avoided searching for evidence of coseismic subsidence in the Umpqua estuary because, as the largest river basin in the Oregon Coast Range, the estuary is strongly dominated by freshwater and large winter floods. Near and upriver from Highway 101, many marshes are probably underlain by largely freshwater peaty and muddy sediment.  Downriver from the highway much marsh sediment is sandy because of the extensive active and stabalized dune fields to the west along the coast. Thick sand beds, inferred to have been deposited by the 1700 CE tsunami, have been reported along the banks of Steamboat Island, but are hard to distinguish from fluvial sediment.\n"
