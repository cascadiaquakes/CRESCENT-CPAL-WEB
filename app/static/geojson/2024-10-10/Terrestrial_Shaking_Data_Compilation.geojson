The first 12 events are dated in the Brothers et al. (2024) manuscript using an OxCal Sequence and P_Sequence model - the Sequence model ages are entered here. The earlier events are presented in Brothers et al. (2024) SSA abstract, to be finalized and published in a peer-reviewed source subsequently. The MTDs in Ozette Lake are identifiable within cores as sandier layers and also as high amplitude reflections in Chirp data. Estimated shaking from megathrust and crustal fault sources nearby suggest that Ozette Lake turbidites are likely generated from CSZ events, however there is a possibility that a larger rupture than anticipated on the Lake Creek - Boundary Creek/Sadie Creek fault zone can generate lake turbidites as well."

The majority of material remobilized is likely from within the lake system, according to abundant lake diatom concentrations within megaturbidite layers. Megaturbidite A suggested to be sourced from the Sledgehammer Point Rockslide, near Mount Storm King, which would have likely produced a tsunami and subsequent seiche. Based on comparison with compiled historical landslide-generated tsunami data (Clark et al., 2015), the Sledgehammer Point Rockslide may have produced opposite-shore displacement wave up to 82-104 m in height. Megaturbidite B is thought to have originated from a slide that isolated Lake Crescent and Lake Sutherland and lead to lake level rise of ~24 meters, based on drowned tree chronologies (Pringle et al., 2010). Megaturbidite C may have originated from a southerly rockslide, and Megaturbidite D iwas possibly generated from a rockslide near Pyramid Peak.\nThere are also thinner turbidite layers identified but not carefully dated. These beds are 4-5 cm thick along the lake basin margins and thicken to 4-32 cm thick near the southern basin. Most of them are composed of 2-3 stacked fining upward layers. The sand is a miz of volcanic and sedimentary lithin provenance according to petrographic analyses."

                "Notes": "This paper focuses on the timing and mechanisms of megaturbidite generation in Lake Crescent. Megaturbidites A-D are interpreted as large lake disturbance events from major rock slides entering the lake, triggered by crustal earthquakes on the Lake Creek-Boundary Creek fault zone that runs through the lake system. The majority of material remobilized is likely from within the lake system, according to abundant lake diatom concentrations within megaturbidite layers. Megaturbidite A suggested to be sourced from the Sledgehammer Point Rockslide, near Mount Storm King, which would have likely produced a tsunami and subsequent seiche. Based on comparison with compiled historical landslide-generated tsunami data (Clark et al., 2015), the Sledgehammer Point Rockslide may have produced opposite-shore displacement wave up to 82-104 m in height. Megaturbidite B is thought to have originated from a slide that isolated Lake Crescent and Lake Sutherland and lead to lake level rise of ~24 meters, based on drowned tree chronologies (Pringle et al., 2010). Megaturbidite C may have originated from a southerly rockslide, and Megaturbidite D iwas possibly generated from a rockslide near Pyramid Peak.\nThere are also thinner turbidite layers identified but not carefully dated. These beds are 4-5 cm thick along the lake basin margins and thicken to 4-32 cm thick near the southern basin. Most of them are composed of 2-3 stacked fining upward layers. The sand is a miz of volcanic and sedimentary lithin provenance according to petrographic analyses."

Several cores penetrate into sub-lacustrine strata and radiocarbon dating suggest that Bradley Lake was established ~7300 years ago. The outlet of Bradley lake is currently 5.5 m asl, the base is -4-5 m asl. 17 disturbance events are identified. 12 of the events are interpreted as coseismic CSZ tsunamis based on marine diatom evidence of seawater incursion, several of which are associated with lasting (years to decades) brackish diatom blooms. Disturbance event (DE) 3, 14, 15, 16 do not have evidence for marine seawater incursion, although DE16 is associated with a subsequent brackish diatom bloom. These events are therefore not likely tsunamis, but are instead interpreted as subaqueous slope failure during coseismic shaking. Calibrated ages from samples entered into \"Published Age\" column. Kelsey et al. provide OxCal modeled ages (using V-sequence), entered into \"Remodeled Age\" column"

Radiocarbon ages of features recording inland crustal faulting overlap the 900\u20131300 age of vented sand at Copalis; this permits liquefaction or squeezing at Copalis caused by an earthquake on the Seattle or other fault in the Puget Lowland."

The Chehakis dikes were only evident at distances >60 km from the coast, from which Obermeier infers that the liquefaction source was a \"local seismic source\". Additionally (and notably), the 1949 earthquake produced sand boils in Centralia WA (photograph in Chleborod and Schuster (1998). 12 sites along the Chehalis River are described in the manuscript, named CH-A through CH-M. At CH-I, a detrital charcoal fragment dated (1820\u00b160) from upper layer deposited after dike emplaced places a maximum limiting age on dike emplacmeent above top of dike.  At CH-J, charcoal fragments dated at contact of cap with source sands and gravels (3100\u00b1180) provide a maximum age of the host sediment, which predates the liquefaction. At CH-L, dikes are up to 30cm wide and may be associated with extensive slumping. 'Many' hemlock leaves dates to 3350 +60/-14 cal yr BP from contact of cap and sand/gravel liquefaction source. 4050+/-90 date from charcoal from soil onto which sand boil vented (max.)
